# Poll Client

A modern, responsive React application serving as the frontend for the [poll REST API](https://github.com/vncsmyrnk/poll). This client allows users to browse active polls, view real-time results via interactive charts, and cast votes.

## 📦 Deployment & On-Premise

This application is production-ready and containerized, making it suitable for both cloud deployments and **on-premise environments**. This project provide pre-built docker images at [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vncsmyrnk/poll-client).
